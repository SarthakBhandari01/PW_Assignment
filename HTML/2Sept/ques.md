```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>HTML Example</title>
  </head>

    <h1>HTML defines the content and structure of your website</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Ques 2

Comments in HTML are used to leave notes or explanations within the code that will not be displayed in the browser. They are useful for documentation and for making the code easier to understand for others or for future reference.

#### Example

```html
<!-- This is a comment in HTML -->
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

### Ques4

A tag is a part of HTML syntax that defines the start and end of an element. An element consists of a start tag, content, and an end tag.

#### Example

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

In the example above, `<p>` is the start tag, `</p>` is the end tag, and `This is a paragraph.` is the content. Together, they form a paragraph element.

### Ques 5

The DOCTYPE declaration in HTML is used to specify the version of HTML that the document is using. It ensures that the browser renders the page correctly according to the specified HTML standards.

#### Example

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

This declaration is for HTML5.
