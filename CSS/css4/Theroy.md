## Q1. Main Differences

**CSS Flexbox:**

- One-dimensional layout model.
- Aligns items along a single axis (either row or column).
- Best for distributing space within a container.

**CSS Grid:**

- Two-dimensional layout model.
- Aligns items along both rows and columns.
- Best for creating complex layouts with rows and columns.

**When to Use:**

- **Flexbox:** Use for simpler, one-dimensional layouts where you need to align items in a row or column.
- **Grid:** Use for more complex, two-dimensional layouts where you need to control both rows and columns.

## Q2. Key Properties in Flexbox

- **justify-content:** Aligns items along the main axis (horizontal by default).
- **align-items:** Aligns items along the cross axis (vertical by default).
- **gap:** Defines the space between flex items.
- **flex-direction:** Specifies the direction of the flex items (row, row-reverse, column, column-reverse).
- **flex-wrap:** Controls whether flex items should wrap onto multiple lines.
