## Ques 1

- Operators in JS perform operations on variables and values, such as arithmetic operations, comparison, and logical operations. They are essential for data manipulation and controlling the flow of execution.

## Ques 2

- **Arithmetic Operators**

  ```js
  const s = 1 + 2;
  ```

- **Assignment Operators**

  ```js
  const s = 5; // 5 assigned to s
  ```

- **Comparison Operators**

  ```js
  const e = 5 > 3; // returns true
  ```

- **Logical Operators**

  ```js
  const result = true && false; // returns false
  ```

- **Ternary Operator**

  ```js
  let result = age >= 18 ? "Adult" : "Minor";
  ```

- **Bitwise Operators**

  ```js
  let and = 5 & 3; // Bitwise AND
  ```

- **Unary Operators**
  ```js
  const x = 5;
  x++; // x=6
  ```

## Ques 3

- **Unary Operators**: Operate on a single operand. Example: `x++` increments `x` by 1.
- **Binary Operators**: Operate on two operands. Example: `5 + 3` adds 5 and 3.
- **Ternary Operator**: Operates on three operands. Example: `age >= 18 ? "Adult" : "Minor"` returns "Adult" if `age` is 18 or more, otherwise "Minor".


## Ques 4

- **Precedence** determines the order in which operators are evaluated in expressions. 
- **Associativity** defines the direction (left-to-right or right-to-left) in which operators of the same precedence level are processed. 
- Understanding  of these concepts is crucial for writing correct and predictable code, as it helps avoid logical errors and ensures the intended operations are performed.
