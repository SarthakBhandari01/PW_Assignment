# JavaScript Assignment Questions

## Question 1
**Explain what JavaScript is and its role in web development.**

JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily used for creating interactive and dynamic content on websites. It enables developers to enhance user experience by manipulating the DOM, handling events, and communicating with servers.

## Question 2
**Explain the key differences between JavaScript and HTML. Provide examples of situations where you would use each.**

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used for structuring content on the web, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, and images. JavaScript, on the other hand, is used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. For example, HTML is used to create a form, while JavaScript is used to validate the form inputs.

## Question 3
**List and describe the five primitive data types in JavaScript.**

1. **String**: Represents textual data, e.g., `"Hello, World!"`.
2. **Number**: Represents numeric values, e.g., `42`.
3. **Boolean**: Represents logical values, `true` or `false`.
4. **Undefined**: Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
5. **Null**: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.

## Question 4
**What is the purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript, and how do you declare them using the 'let' keyword?**

Declaring variables in JavaScript allows you to store and manipulate data within your program. Variables declared with the `let` keyword are block-scoped and can be reassigned. Example: `let age = 25;`

## Question 5
**Explain the importance of comments in JavaScript and provide examples of single-line and multi-line comments.**

Comments are crucial for documenting code, making it easier to understand and maintain. Single-line comment: `// This is a single-line comment`. Multi-line comment: `/* This is a multi-line comment */`.

## Question 6
**Explain the importance of choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript. Provide an example where using a clear identifier improves code readability.**

Using meaningful and descriptive variable names enhances code readability and maintainability by clearly conveying the purpose of the variable. Example: `let userAge = 30;` is more readable than `let x = 30;`.
